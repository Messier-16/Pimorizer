# Pimorizer
Just a quick script I made to memorize digits of pi. Should be practical for up to ~1000 digits, but I wouldn't suggest brute force methods such as this if you want to memorize that many.

How it works:
1) Type in the digits of pi, past the decimal. 
2) The script will return the correct digits you wrote in order, along with the next 5 digits on the next line.
3) Repeat over and over again. This can be thought of as some form of reinforcement learning / memorization, the goal being you review all past knowledge over and over again as you learn new digits.
